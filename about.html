				<h3>Our Start</h3>
				<p>This company was founded by Nina Basalt in 2016. She wanted to make clothing that appealed to her sensibilities, as she always found that many clothes, both male and female, were catered towards a certain body type. As such, she wanted to make clothes that people could buy that would match their body type and could even be designed by people for them to try out. </p>
				<h3>Our Brand</h3>
				<p>Pastel aesthetic specifically means pastel colors used in works, such as shown in the image hear. With how there are many negative things in the world, we wish to make a positive change via clothing, giving people an option for clothes that can help bring a colorful change to your world.</p>
